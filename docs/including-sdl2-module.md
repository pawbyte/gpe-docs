# Getting Started

![libsdl2!](https://docs.gamepencil.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/03/SDL_logo.png "SDL library")

Written for both 32-bit and 64-bit systems. Although we default to 32-bit for the editor, we plan to add 64-bit executables in the future
In order to successfully compile Game Pencilâ€™s Editor you will need the following libraries:

- SDL2 - [Download library](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php) Game Pencil currently uses 2.0.18
- SDL2_image [Download library](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/) - Search for development libraries and find your supported OS.
- SDL2_mixer [Download library](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/) - Search for development libraries and find your supported OS.
- SDL2_ttf [Download library](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/) - Search for development libraries and find your supported OS.

## Creating SDL Projects in C/C++

Our heroes at [lazyfoo](http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/01_hello_SDL/index.php) has created a set of detailed tutorials for getting an SDL application working in a few popular C++ IDEs

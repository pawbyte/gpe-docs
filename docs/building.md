For starters head over to our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/pawbyte/Game-Pencil-Engine) and download a .zip file containing Game Pencil's source. Extract it and then follow the instructions below.

It is recommended to use [CodeBlocks](http://www.codeblocks.org/) to compile Game Pencil although other IDEs should compile the editor just as fine. We do provide our CodeBlocks project file alongside the source so one does not have to worry about makefiles and you see exactly what we see when we code updates for the editor.

## C++ Version?

Game Pencil's current codebase just uses basic C++ 11 and whichever modular system of your choice. . The "toughest part" to compiling Game Pencil is just properly linking and utilizing your Module's dependencies. **Please note, some backend modules may require C++17.**

title: Building Game Pencil Engine 
---

## Developer Instructions

### Step One: Choose your operating system

Steps to build Game Pencil Engine from scratch for each operating system.
Game Pencil Engine is platform dependent and as such there are different guides per operating system:

* [Game Pencil for Windows](quick-start-guide/building-windows)

* [Game Pencil for Linux](quick-start-guide/building-linux)

* [Game Pencil for Mac](quick-start-guide/building-mac)

* [Game Pencil for BSD](quick-start-guide/building-bsd)

## Help, I don't see my computer type listed above

Don't see your operating system listed here? Please check if one of the following libraries work on your operating system:

* SDL 2.0.18 or higher
* SDL 1
* Raylib by raysan

If not, can you recall any recent games or applications ported to your operating system?
Perhaps there is another module we need to add...

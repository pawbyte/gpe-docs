## Getting Started ( Work In Progress )

To get started we advise you look at the [SFML official guides](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/) for getting SFML working with your IDE/Compiler of Choice.

CodeBlocks, being our primary IDE, we've added a few extra steps for those who need to get the editor working.

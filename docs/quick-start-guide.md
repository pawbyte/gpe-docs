# Basic Requirements

Game Pencil Engine was originally created on a 2013 Asus laptop. It has also been tested on decides from 2010 and ran with no errors. The key minimum requirements are 2GB of RAM, 720p or higher screen resolution for ease of use and 200MB (can run off of USB or CD/DVD as well). If using older hardware, please toggle the editorâ€™s FPS setting to be 30 FPS or only render on changes.

Currently the shipped version of Game Pencil Engine is the SDL2 module based version, the same system requirements have rung true for raylib and sfml based modules.
